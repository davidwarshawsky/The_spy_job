[Espa√±ol](https://github.com/XDeadHackerX/The_spy_job) | [English](https://github.com/SobrioRiot/The_spy_job)

> Tool created by XDeadHackerX. Translated by David Warshawsky and in the process of being ported to work for Mac by David Warshawsky. As part of building my cyber capabilities and portfolio, I will be working on translating this to english and making it work on Mac. Potentially even a package for brew.

**The_Spy's_Job**. *This tool is focused on* **OSINT** *in almost all areas* **(People, Nicknames, Social Media, Emails, Phone Numbers, Websites, Public IPs, and Images)**. *The ideas was to gather and automate all the most advanced OSINT techniques in a single tool to work in the most comfortable and fast way as possible, as we only have to click a couple of times and it will automatically collect and display all the information in an organized and classified manner. All the sections are separated so that you can extract specific types of information, but it also has the penultimate option that combines all the options to extract everything it can from the given data.*

## üé≤ Considerations üé≤

**[1]** In Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements), when selecting Option 1 to Install the Requirements, it will ask for a user that **does not** have root permissions. This step is very important because if we enter a user with root permissions, or we enter it incorrectly or enter it twice, the options that need to open a browser from the Terminal will not work.

**[2]** In Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements), you can configure the veriphone.io, shodan.io, and zoomeye.org API to get the most out of this Tool. Both are free.

**[3]** In Section ([7] Public IP Information), when using a VPN, most servers give incorrect responses about their ports. To solve this, I have included several scanners, and 2 of them give you the correct ports despite the VPN.

**[4]** Use the tool with Firefox closed, as the tool opens multiple tabs, and if Firefox is already running, an error will occur.

**[5]** I personally recommend using the Tool with the Terminal in Full Screen (Visually more appealing).

**[6]** If you have downloaded an older version, I advise you to delete it and reinstall the tool (+requirements) to fix errors and get improvements that make the tool much better than previous versions.

* I am currently using version 2.1 in order to port it and convert to english using Prompt_Engineering.txt with Github Copilot.  *
